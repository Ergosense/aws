# AWS IoT support for Mongoose OS

## Overview

Mongoose OS is integrated natively with AWS IoT cloud.

That single command performs the certificate management for you, and
onboard your device on AWS IoT cloud. If your device has an
[Atmel ECC508A](http://www.atmel.com/devices/ATECC508A.aspx) secure element
attached, then Mongoose Firmware will use ECC508A chip for TLS handshake
and keep your credentials secure.
